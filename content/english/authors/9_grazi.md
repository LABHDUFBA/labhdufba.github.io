Currently, a student of Anthropology at the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC) since 2019, I hold a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from the University of Vale do Paraíba (UNIVAP, 1998) and a postgraduate degree in Accounting and Financial Administration from Fundação Armando Álvares Penteado (FAAP, 2000); With twelve years of experience in the traditional financial market, my research interests include digital anthropology, blockchain data infrastructures, digital currencies, and emerging forms of identity and social organization in Web3. I am currently involved in a Scientific Initiation project with the Digital Humanities Laboratory at UFBA, focusing on monitoring masculinist segments on Telegram.
