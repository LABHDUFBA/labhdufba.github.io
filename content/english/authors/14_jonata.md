I am conducting doctoral research on Innovation Policies that guide the management of actions and projects in public law ICTs, with a focus on a civic-democratic approach to Social Innovation; My other research interests include Sociological and Post-Colonial Perspectives in Science, Technology, and Innovation (ST&I), the role of Digital Humanities in producing innovations within public law ICTs, and the interplay of Ethics, Citizenship, and Human Rights in ST&I. Additionally, I explore the roles, uses, and meanings of Sociology in scientific production and the development of technologies and innovations within the Federal Network of Professional and Technological Education.
