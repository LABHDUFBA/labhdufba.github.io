I am conducting doctoral research on Innovation Policies guiding the management of actions and projects in publicly owned ICTs, focusing on a civic-democratic approach to Social Innovation. My other research interests include Sociological and Post-Colonial Perspectives in Science, Technology, and Innovation (ST&I), the role of Digital Humanities in driving innovations within publicly owned ICTs, and the interrelation between Ethics, Citizenship, and Human Rights in ST&I. Additionally, I explore the roles, uses, and meanings of Sociology in scientific production and in the development of technologies and innovations within the Federal Network of Professional and Technological Education.
