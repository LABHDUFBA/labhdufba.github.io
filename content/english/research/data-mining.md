Data Mining for Digital Humanities

![](/images/research-data-mining.png)

The acquisition of computational skills in research practice across various fields of the humanities is one of the pillars of what is being called Digital Humanities. Currently, a multitude of digital tools are available that assist in the extraction and assembly of databases, in the analysis and interpretation of this material, and finally, in the organization and dissemination of results. LABHDUFBA develops data extraction algorithms for the web and digital social networks. Furthermore, it aims to provide critical reflection on how these digital tools may represent new ways of structuring imagination and investigations in different humanities fields, requiring us to evaluate 'how far it is possible to think' within the logics that structure these algorithms.
