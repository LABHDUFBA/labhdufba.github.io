## [Digital Tools Wiki](http://www.larhud.ibict.br/index.php?title=Página_principal) 

In 2018, the Networked Laboratory of Digital Humanities at the Brazilian Institute of Information in Science and Technology (IBICT) created the first version of the digital tools wiki. The goal was to serve as a reference base and information hub for the dissemination of knowledge in the digital environment aimed at researchers in the field of Information Science (interested in the topic of Digital Humanities) and humanities in general in the Portuguese language.

Starting from 2020, the Larhud Wiki now has the partnership of the Digital Humanities Laboratory at UFBA (LABHD-UFBA), becoming the Wiki of tutorials for digital humanities tools from these two laboratories!

The wiki is entirely in Portuguese, with a glossary and a list of the most commonly used tools for research in digital humanities.
